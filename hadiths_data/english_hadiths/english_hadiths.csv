     Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:
<p>

     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""The reward of deeds depends upon the 
     intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he 
     has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman
     to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.""

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Apostle ""O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."" 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).

     Narrated Said bin Jubair:
<p>

     Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the statement of Allah ""Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith."" (75.16) said ""Allah's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration."" Ibn 'Abbas moved his lips saying, ""I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's Apostle used to move his."" Said moved his lips saying: ""I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his."" Ibn 'Abbas added, ""So Allah revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran)' (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet) remember the portion of the Qur'an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The statement of Allah: 'And when we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Quran) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it.""

<p>

     Allah's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used 
     to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel 
     met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him 
     the Qur'an. Allah's Apostle was the most generous person, even more 
     generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste 
     to do charitable deeds).

<p>

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
<p>

     Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to
     him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were 
     merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and 
     Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan 
     and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to 
     Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and 
     he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his 
     translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, ""Who 
     amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a 
     Prophet?"" Abu Sufyan replied, ""I am the nearest relative to him 
     (amongst the group).""
<p>

     Heraclius said, ""Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his 
     companions stand behind him."" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his 
     translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions 
     to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they 
     (my companions) should contradict me."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah! 
     Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not
     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked 
     me about him was:
<p>

     'What is his family status amongst you?' 
<p>

     I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' 
<p>

     Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the 
     same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'
<p>

     He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'
<p>

     I replied, 'They are increasing.'
<p>

     He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion 
     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his 
     claim (to be a Prophet)?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No. '
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he 
     will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against 
     him except that.
<p>

     Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'Yes.'
<p>

     Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'
<p>

     I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'
<p>

     I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to 
     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our 
     ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be 
     chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'
<p>

     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked 
     you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very 
     noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families 
     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody 
     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.
     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that 
     this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you 
     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the 
     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought 
     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.
<p>

     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he 
     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered 
     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a 
     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed 
     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. 
     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of 
     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or 
     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is
     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further 
     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his 
     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was
     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when 
     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked 
     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and 
     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered 
     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah 
     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to 
     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be 
     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this 
     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he 
     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and 
     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him 
     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius 
     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle
<p>

     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded 
     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: 
     ""In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) 
     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the 
     ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. 
     Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will
     be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this 
     invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your 
     Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)
<p>

     'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that 
     we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship 
     with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.
     Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those 
     who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).
<p>

     Abu Sufyan then added, ""When Heraclius had finished his speech and had
     read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So 
     we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the 
     question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so 
     prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of
     him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the 
     conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided 
     me to it).""
<p>

     The sub narrator adds, ""Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' 
     (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn 
     An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' 
     (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his 
     priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller 
     and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I
     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared 
     (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The 
     people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you
     should not be afraid of them (Jews).
<p>

     'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'
<p>

     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan
     to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. 
     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see
     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after 
     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then 
     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice
     circumcision.'
<p>

     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs
     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who 
     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. 
     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his 
     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the 
     emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that 
     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his 
     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of 
     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If 
     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your 
     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet 
     (i.e. embrace Islam).'
<p>

     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates 
     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius 
     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their
     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in 
     audience.
<p>

     (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the 
     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated
     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of 
     Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).

     best of the lot. I asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that 
     person? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer."" The Prophet 
     commented: ""Or merely a Muslim."" I remained quiet for a while, but 
     could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him.
     And then asked Allah's Apostle, ""Why have you left so and so? By 
     Allah! He is a faithful believer."" The Prophet again said, ""Or merely 
     a Muslim."" And I could not help repeating my question because of what 
     I knew about him. Then the Prophet said, ""O Sa'd! I give to a person 
     while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his
     face in the Fire by Allah.""

     When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers
     or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing 
     Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
     wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
     prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the 
     company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer 
     with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were 
     bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
     them, ""By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle 
     facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
     direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the 
     scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in 
     prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
     the prayers, they disapproved of it.

     Al-Bara' added, ""Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba 
     (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we 
     did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah

believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca

last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake 
up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator `Auf said that Abu Raja' had told 
him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was `Umar bin Al- 
Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to 
get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, `Umar got up 
and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, ""Allahu Akbar"" and raised his 
voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the 
people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, ""There is no harm (or it will not be 
harmful). Depart!"" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet 
stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call 
for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he 
saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, ""O so and so! What has 
prevented you from praying with us?"" He replied, ""I am Junub and there is no water. "" The Prophet 
said, ""Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."" 
Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down 
and called a person (the narrator `Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 
`Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who 
was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, ""Where can we find water?"" She 
replied, ""I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me."" They 
requested her to accompany them. She asked, ""Where?"" They said, ""To Allah's Apostle ."" She said, 
""Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?"" They replied, ""Yes, the same 
person. So come along."" They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, ""Help 
her to dismount."" The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured 
some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and 
the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. 
So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others 
and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it 
over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. 
By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than 
they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something 
for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a 
piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of foodstuff was also placed in 
front of her and then the Prophet said to her, ""We have not taken your water but Allah has given water 
to us."" She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: ""O so and so what has delayed you?"" She said, 
""A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such 
and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her 
index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is 
Allah's true Apostle."" 
Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. 
One day she said to her people, ""I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any 
inclination to Islam?"" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.

<p>Allah's Apostle said, ""While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, 
opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom 
and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and 
ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the 
gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 
'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He 
asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest 
heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he 
looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 
'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and 
the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of 
Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and 
when he looks towards his left he weeps.' 
Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 
'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said 
and he opened the gate. Anas said: ""Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus 
and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he 
(the Prophet ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, ""When 
Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious

Then I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 
'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham. The Prophet added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a 
place where I heard the creaking of the pens."" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, 
""Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed 
by Moses who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined 
fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers 
will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to 
half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your 
followers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and 
half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your 
followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, 'These are five prayers and 
they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.' I returned to Moses and he told 
me to go back once again. I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel took me

indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls

<p>Sahl bin Sa`d was asked about the (Prophet's) pulpit as to what thing it was made of? Sahl replied: 
""None remains alive amongst the people, who knows about it better than I. It was made of tamarisk 
(wood) of the forest. So and so, the slave of so and so prepared it for Allah's Apostle . When it was 
constructed and place (in the Mosque), Allah's Apostle stood on it facing the Qibla and said 'Allahu 
Akbar', and the people stood behind him (and led the people in prayer). He recited and bowed and the 
people bowed behind him. Then he raised his head and stepped back, got down and prostrated on the 
ground and then he again ascended the pulpit, recited, bowed, raised his head and stepped back, got 
down and prostrate on the ground. So, this is what I know about the pulpit.""

<p>When the Prophet arrived Medina he dismounted at `Awali-i-Medina amongst a tribe called Banu 
`Amr bin `Auf. He stayed there For fourteen nights. Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came 
armed with their swords. As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet was sitting over his Rahila 
(Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at 
the courtyard of Abu Aiyub's house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was 
due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of 
Banu-An-Najjar and said, ""O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land 
of yours."" They replied, ""No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah."" Anas added: 
There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees 
in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led 
and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees 
towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). 
His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and 
he kept on saying, ""There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the 
Ansars and the emigrants. """,8.0,,,,78,104290,2012-04-26 07:00:00

Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abu Bakr 
thought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did so. He used to pray and recite 
the Qur'an in it. The pagan women and their children used to stand by him and look at him with 
surprise. Abu Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting the Qur'an. 
The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of that (i.e. that their children and women might be 
affected by the recitation of Qur'an).",8.0,,,,124,104760,2012-04-26 07:00:00

step which he takes towards the mosque, Allah upgrades him a degree in reward and (forgives) 
crosses out one sin till he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque he is considered in prayer as 
long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on asking for Allah's forgiveness for him and 
they keep on saying: 'O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on

fingers and then put his J right cheek on the back of his left hand. The people who were in haste left 
the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them 
were Abu Bakr and `Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul- 
Yadain asked the Prophet, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?' 
The Prophet replied, 'I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced' The Prophet added, 'Is 
what Dhul Yadain has said true?' They (the people) said, 'Yes, it is true.' The Prophet stood up again 
and led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Taslim, and 
then said, 'Allahu Akbar.' And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that. He

doubt whether `Abdur Rahman also said, 'My wife and our servant who was common for both my 
house and Abu Bakr's house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the 
`Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his 
meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr's 
wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' 
She said, 'They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused."" `Abdur 
Rahman added, ""I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu 
Bakr) called me, 'O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me and then 
said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath 
that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the 
guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to 
our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. 
Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He 
addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my 
eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, 'That 
(oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it 
and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty 
between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us 
into twelve (groups) (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many 
men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.""",10.0,,,,78,106040,2012-04-26 07:00:00

was a liar.<p>
Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b:

<p>The Prophet said, ""Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, ""Who 
is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, ""I am the most learned."" Allah admonished 
Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him ""At the 
junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you."" Moses 
said, ""O my Lord! How can I meet him?"" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and 
you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) 
boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their 
heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a 
tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest 
of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: ""Bring us 
our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey."" Moses did not get tired till 
he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, ""Do you remember 
when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish."" Moses remarked, ""That is what we 
have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they 
saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. 
Al-Khadir replied saying, ""How do people greet each other in your land?"" 
Moses said, ""I am Moses."" He asked, ""The Moses of Bani Israel?"" Moses replied in the affirmative 
and added, ""May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught."" 
Al-Khadir replied, ""Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of 
the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some 
knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know."" Moses said, ""Allah willing, you will 
find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the 
seashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the 
crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board 
without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice 
in the sea. Al-Khadir said: ""O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's 
knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak."" Al- 
Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, ""These people gave us a 
free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people."" Al-Khadir replied, 
""Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me."" Moses said, ""Call me not to 
account for what I forgot."" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. 
Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the 
boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, ""Have you 
killed an innocent soul who has killed none."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Did I not tell you that you cannot 
remain patient with me?"" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they 
asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of 
collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, ""If you had wished, surely you 
could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir replied, ""This is the parting between you and me."" The 
Prophet added, ""May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to 
learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. """,3.0,,,,64,101220,2012-04-26 07:00:00

He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, ""I do not know how to read."" The Prophet added, ""The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, ""I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija replied, ""Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.""  Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters.
